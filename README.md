> A curated collection of practical Python and Shell scripts for everyday tasks. This is the sister project of [Method-List](https://github.com/Youchenjiang/Method-List), providing ready-to-use tools that complement the knowledge base.

## Introduction

Script List is a curated collection of practical scripts and automation tools. It serves as the companion project to Method-List:

- **[Method-List](https://github.com/Youchenjiang/Method-List)**: 📚 Technical knowledge base (documentation)
- **Script-List**: 🛠️ Practical script tools (executable programs)

**Method-List teaches you "how to do it", Script-List gives you "tools to use directly".**

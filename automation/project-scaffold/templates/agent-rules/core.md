## 🛡️ Mandatory Authorization Gate & Safety Boundaries

This is a hard safety boundary for every agent session.

### 1. Action Classification Before Any Tool Call
Before performing any tool call, categorize the intended action into one of three tiers:

- **Read-only**:
  - Inspect files, Git status/history, build/test logs, CI status, or external state.
  - *Status*: **Allowed by default**.
- **Local edit**:
  - Modify or create files only when explicitly requested by the user.
  - *Status*: Allowed for the requested scope. **Does NOT imply permission to commit, push, or publish**.
- **External mutation / Remote State Change**:
  - Any branch creation/switching, commit, push/force-push, tag modification, PR creation/merge, GitHub Actions workflow dispatch/cancel, release publishing, or external store deployment.
  - *Status*: **Requires explicit authorization from the user** in the current conversation turn.

### 2. Scope Non-Transitivity
- Authorization for operation A never extends to operation B. (e.g., authorizing a tag push does not authorize creating a PR or bumping versions).
- If an authorized operation fails and a different operation is needed, report the failure evidence and stop. Never expand authorization autonomously.
- If the user revokes or objects to an action, stop immediately. Never execute autonomous "cleanup" (such as deleting branches or force-pushing) without separate explicit authorization.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach (Stop Brute Force)

When you encounter an error, test failure, build break, or unexpected state:

- **Do NOT** blindly guess or try random trial-and-error fixes. Each failed attempt without understanding the root cause is wasted effort.
- **DO** stop and observe the underlying mechanism first. Read the exact error stack trace, inspect the relevant source code, and consult documentation. Understand *why* it fails before attempting a fix.
- **DO** normalize the problem to its minimum reproducible unit. Verify the smallest possible piece first, then scale up.
- **DO** ask yourself: *"Am I diagnosing the root cause, or just hoping random edits will make it pass?"*

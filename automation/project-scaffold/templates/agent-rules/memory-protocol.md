## 🧠 Persistent Memory Protocol

Every agent session must maintain continuity across sessions via `MEMORY.md`:

### 1. Start of Session (CRITICAL — Execute First)
- Read `MEMORY.md` in the workspace root at the beginning of the session.
- Absorb recorded user preferences, active tasks, project architectural context, and prior decisions.
- Do not ask the user to re-explain background details already documented in `MEMORY.md`.

### 2. End of Session
- Update `MEMORY.md` before ending:
  - Record new architectural decisions and rationale.
  - Update current active tasks and blockers.
  - Append a concise session history entry.
  - Preserve critical technical lessons learned and platform pitfalls.
